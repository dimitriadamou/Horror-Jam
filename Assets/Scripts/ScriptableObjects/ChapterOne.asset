  Lines:
  - Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century.
  - This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first
    brought the region to the worlds notice.
  - The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch
    civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded
    only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful
    hamlets on isolated slopes.
